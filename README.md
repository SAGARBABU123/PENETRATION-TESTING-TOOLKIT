#¬†ABOUT¬†PROJECT
The penetration testing toolkit is a Python-based modular toolkit designed to identify vulnerabilities in a target network by performing various penetration testing techniques. The toolkit includes multiple modules, such as:

1. Port Scanner
The port scanner module scans a target IP address for open and closed ports.
It tries to establish a connection with the specified ports.
The output shows:
‚úÖ [+] ‚Äì If the port is open and accessible.
‚ùå [-] ‚Äì If the port is closed or not responding.
Example from your output:

swift
Copy
Edit
[+] Scanning 8.8.8.8...
[-] Port 20 is CLOSED
[-] Port 21 is CLOSED
[-] Port 22 is CLOSED
‚û°Ô∏è The toolkit scanned ports 20, 21, and 22 on 8.8.8.8 (Google's DNS server) and reported that all of them are closed.

2. Brute Forcer
The brute force module attempts to guess login credentials by trying multiple username and password combinations.
This is useful for testing the strength of login security on websites and other services.
3. Additional Features
The toolkit is designed to be modular, allowing you to add more penetration testing techniques (e.g., vulnerability scanning, packet sniffing).
It provides real-time feedback on the status of ports and connection attempts.
‚úÖ Purpose
Identify vulnerabilities in network security.
Test for weak passwords and misconfigured services.
Help secure the system by identifying open attack surfaces.
üöÄ Outcome
Successful penetration testing helps network administrators identify and fix security gaps before attackers can exploit them.
The toolkit is a practical way to strengthen the overall security posture of a network or application.
